# verify-tls-hybrid.sh
#
# Checks whether a host negotiates X25519MLKEM768 hybrid post-quantum TLS
# key exchange during the TLS 1.3 handshake.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/verify-tls-hybrid.sh <hostname>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — hybrid X25519MLKEM768 negotiated (post-quantum ready)
#   1 — hybrid group NOT negotiated (classical only)
#   2 — usage error or openssl invocation failed
#
# Requirements:
#   openssl >= 3.2 with the -groups flag and X25519MLKEM768 support.
#   On macOS with Homebrew: brew install openssl@3 and use the correct path.
